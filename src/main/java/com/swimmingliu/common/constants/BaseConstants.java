            **Prompt to Determine if User Question Requires Internet Search**
            
            Your primary task is to analyze the user's question provided below and determine if an internet search is necessary to provide an accurate, complete, and up-to-date answer. Evaluate the question against the following criteria in the order presented. Your final output must be solely 'true' (indicating an internet search is needed) or 'false' (indicating an internet search is not needed).
            
            **1. Mandatory Internet Search for Specialized Terminology:**
            
            * If the question contains or revolves around specific jargon, technical terms, scientific concepts, discipline-specific vocabulary (e.g., medical, legal, engineering terms), or named theories/models/processes that are crucial for a correct and nuanced answer, respond `true`. This rule prioritizes fetching the most accurate and potentially updated information for specialized topics, even if the concept itself is established.
                * Example: "Explain the Heckscher-Ohlin model." -> `true`
                * Example: "What are the applications of CRISPR-Cas9?" -> `true`
                * Example: "Define epistemology." -> `true`
                * Example: "What is a carburetor?" -> `true`
                * Example: "Describe the symptoms of 'Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis'." -> `true`
                 * Example: "How to learn Java." -> `true`
                * **Exclusion for clarity:** This rule generally does not apply if the "term" is an extremely common globally-known proper noun and the question is about very basic, universally known facts associated with it (e.g., "What is the capital of France?"). It also doesn't apply to extremely common everyday objects or concepts unless the query implies a technical or deeper dive (e.g., "What is water?" is `false`, but "Explain the molecular structure of water and its anomalous properties." would be `true` due to "molecular structure" and "anomalous properties").
            * **If this rule (1) definitively dictates `true`, you do not need to evaluate further. Output `true`. Otherwise, proceed to Section 2.**
            
            **2. Initial Checks for Common/Simple Questions (Potentially `false` if Section 1 did not result in `true`):**
            
            * **A. General Inquiry without Specialized Focus (and no specialized terms from Section 1):**
                * If Section 1 did NOT apply, AND the question uses only common, everyday language, AND does not contain specific jargon or technical terms (beyond those already assessed in Section 1), AND is a general inquiry, this leans towards `false`.
                * *Caveat:* This assessment can be overridden if criteria in Sections 3 or 4 strongly suggest a search is required.
                * Example: "What is the color of the sky?" -> `false`
                * Example: "How to bake a simple cake?" -> `false`
            
            * **B. Common Conversational or Meta-Interaction Questions:**
                * If the question is a standard greeting (e.g., "Hello", "How are you?"), a query about our current interaction (e.g., "What did you say before?", "Can you repeat that?", "What was the last question?"), a very basic request about your own capabilities or identity (e.g., "Who are you?", "What can you do?", "Are you an AI?"), or a simple, self-contained command (e.g., "Tell me a joke," "Give me a random number"), respond `false`.
                * Example: "Who are you?" -> `false`
                * Example: "What was the previous sentence?" -> `false`
            
            **3. Information Type & Characteristics (Triggers for Requiring a Search if Section 1 was not `true`):**
            
            * **A. Current Events or Very Recent Information:**
                * Does the question explicitly or implicitly ask about events that happened very recently (e.g., "today's news," "yesterday's election results," "latest developments in [current event]," "what's happening now with [ongoing situation]")? If YES, respond `true`.
                * Example: "What were the main headlines this morning?" -> `true`
            
            * **B. Time-Sensitive Data (Frequently Changing & Requiring Current Stats):**
                * Does the question concern information that updates frequently and where the user likely expects the latest available data (e.g., "current stock prices for AAPL," "weather forecast for London tomorrow," "live flight status for BA245," "current value of Bitcoin," "what time is it in Tokyo right now?")? If YES, respond `true`.
                * Example: "What is the current temperature in New York?" -> `true`
            
            * **C. Information Likely Beyond Your Knowledge Cutoff:**
                * Does the question pertain to information, events, products, scientific discoveries, or significant updates to existing topics that likely occurred or were published *after* your last training data update (assume a general knowledge cutoff, e.g., early 2025, unless your specific model documentation states otherwise)? If YES, respond `true`.
                * Example (assuming cutoff is early 2025): "Tell me about the features of the phone model released in April 2025." -> `true`
                * Example: "Summarize the key findings of research paper X published last month (April 2025)." -> `true`
            
            * **D. Highly Specific, Niche, or Obscure Factual Data (Not covered by Section 1's terminology rule but still highly specific):**
                * Even if not strictly "specialized terminology," does the question ask for highly specific statistics, obscure facts not widely known, detailed technical specifications for everyday items not commonly known (e.g., "What is the exact refresh rate of the screen on model XYZ of a common laptop brand from 3 years ago?"), contact information for non-public entities, or information on a very niche topic unlikely to be covered comprehensively in general training data? If YES, respond `true`.
                * Example: "What is the current market share of 'LocalBrandX' cookies in rural Idaho?" -> `true`
            
            * **E. Real-time Status or Availability:**
                * Does the question ask about the real-time operational status of a service, availability of a product at a specific location, or current conditions that are not meteorological (e.g., "Is the website X down?", "Are there any traffic jams on I-5 South right now?", "Is the local museum open today?")? If YES, respond `true`.
            
            **4. User's Explicit Intent (Triggers for `true` if Section 1 was not `true`):**
            
            * **A. Explicit Request for Search, Freshness, or External Data:**
                * Does the user explicitly use phrases like "search for," "look up," "find me information on," "get the latest on," "what does the internet say about," "check current sources for," or otherwise clearly indicate a desire for you to consult external, real-time information? If YES, respond `true`.
                * Example: "Search for recent reviews of the new ABC software." -> `true`
            
            **5. General Knowledge & Self-Contained Tasks (Potentially `false` if no preceding rule dictated `true`):**
            
            * **A. Established Facts & General Knowledge (within training data, no specialized terms from Section 1):**
                * If the question relates to well-established historical facts (pre-dating your knowledge cutoff), broadly known scientific principles (explained at a general level, not triggering Section 1), common definitions of everyday words, or widely recognized general knowledge that is stable over time and highly likely to be part of your training data, AND no other rule (1, 3, 4) has triggered a `true`, respond `false`.
                * Example: "What is the capital of France?" -> `false` (assuming "France" doesn't trigger specialized term rule for this basic fact)
                * Example: "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?" -> `false`
            
            * **B. Creative Tasks, Summarization, or Problem-Solving based on Provided Context/General Logic:**
                * If the question asks for creative writing (e.g., "Write a poem about rain"), summarization of text *you already have or is provided in the prompt*, mathematical calculations, code generation, logical reasoning, or general problem-solving that doesn't require new external facts beyond what's in your training or the prompt, AND no other rule (1, 3, 4) has triggered a `true`, respond `false`.
                * Example: "Summarize the concept of supply and demand in simple terms." -> `false` (assuming "supply and demand" is common enough not to trigger rule 1 for a simple explanation)
                * Example: "Solve for x: 3x + 6 = 18" -> `false`
            
            **Decision Logic Summary:**
            1.  **Section 1 (Specialized Terminology) is paramount:** If it determines `true`, that is the final answer.
            2.  If Section 1 is not `true`, then evaluate Sections 3 (Information Type) and 4 (User Intent). If ANY of the conditions in these sections clearly lead to a `true` response, the answer should be `true`.
            3.  If Sections 1, 3, and 4 do not result in `true`, then Section 2 (Common/Simple Questions) and Section 5 (General Knowledge/Self-Contained Tasks) are primarily used to determine a `false` outcome.
            4.  Prioritize `true` if there's a strong indication that your internal knowledge is insufficient, outdated, or not specialized enough for the specific query, especially as indicated by Sections 1, 3, or 4.
