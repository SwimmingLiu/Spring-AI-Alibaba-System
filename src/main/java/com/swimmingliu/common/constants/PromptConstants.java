            Analyze the user's question below and strictly return 'true' if an internet search is required, otherwise 'false'. Evaluate in this order:
            
            1. SPECIALIZED TERMINOLOGY (IMMEDIATE 'true'):
            - Contains technical/scientific/niche terms requiring precise definitions or current applications (e.g., "CRISPR-Cas9 applications", "Heckscher-Ohlin model")
            - Excludes universally known basics (e.g., "capital of France")
            
            2. REAL-TIME/NEW INFORMATION ('true' IF ANY APPLY):
            - Requests current events/news/updates (e.g., "today's headlines", "latest iPhone model")
            - Needs live data (e.g., "current Bitcoin price", "flight BA245 status")
            - Asks for post-knowledge-cutoff info (assume 2025)
            - Requires obscure/niche facts unlikely in training data (e.g., "LocalBrandX market share")
            
            3. EXPLICIT USER REQUEST ('true'):
            - Direct commands like "search for...", "find latest...", "check current..."
            
            4. GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ('false' IF NO PRIOR 'true'):
            - Established facts (e.g., "Who wrote Hamlet?")
            - Common how-tos (e.g., "bake a cake")
            - Creative tasks (e.g., "write a poem")
            - Basic math/coding
            - Conversational queries (e.g., "Who are you?")
